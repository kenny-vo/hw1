#Task 3 - Debug CSS Conflict

This is a single page captured from a CMS system to mock-up an actual support ticket.

**Request from the user:**

"I tried to embed a wistia video on my site and the video is way too big. It's taken over the whole site."

##Instructions

Discover why the video embed on "index.html" isn't staying in its box and fix it.

**Note**: To avoid CORS policy errors with web fonts and javascript; I'd recommend serving this page to yourself with a webserver.
[fenixwebserver](http://fenixwebserver.com/), [Caddyserver](https://caddyserver.com), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/), ["php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t ./"](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php), etc... anything should do the trick.

#Task 2 - Debugging in the browser

This is a single page captured from a CMS system to mock-up an actual support ticket.

**Request from the user:**

"Somehow the entire page is a link. Clicking anywhere on the page takes me to pricing page. I can't expand the bio or interact with the page at all without being sent to the pricing page. Please fix."

##Instructions

Discover why clicking anywhere on "index.html" is behaving like this and fix it.

A fixed page should allow you to expand the bio info below each team members photo.

**Note**: To avoid CORS policy errors with web fonts and javascript; I'd recommend serving this page to yourself with a webserver.
[fenixwebserver](http://fenixwebserver.com/), [Caddyserver](https://caddyserver.com), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/), ["php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t ./"](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php), etc... anything should do the trick.
